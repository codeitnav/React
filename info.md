1. react-dom : used for web dev
2. react-native : used for app dev

in package.json, dev-dependecies : used only for development purposes
                                   they are not sent to the client

react code is often called SPA - single page application
bec all the work is done on a single pg i.e. index.html


<> </> --> this is called fragment
bec jsx components expects you to return only one value,
so, fragments wrap many elements in them and lets the developer return many elements


best practices :
1. the name of the func and file in components should be capitalized,
2. if the component is returning html - file name .jsx
   if the component is returning pure javascript - file name .js
   in vite, file name of component - .jsx
   
### Hooks : 
--> hooks are special functions that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class.

use of **hooks** : UI updation/ data updation --> react controls UI

1. useState : This hook lets you add state to functional components.
--> Syntax: const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
--> useState gives 2 values in terms of array : 1. literal 2.function

2. useEffect: This hook lets you perform side effects in function components. 
--> It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes.
--> Syntax: useEffect(() => { /* effect */ }, [dependencies]);

3. useContext:
--> This hook lets you use the context feature without needing to use the Consumer component.
--> yntax: const value = useContext(MyContext);

4. useReducer:
--> This hook is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.
--> Syntax: const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

5. useRef:
--> This hook lets you persist values between renders and can be used to directly access a DOM element.
--> Syntax: const refContainer = useRef(initialValue);

6. useCallback:
--> This hook returns a memoized callback function. It is useful for optimizing performance by memoizing event handlers and callbacks.
--> Syntax: const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => { /* callback */ }, [dependencies]);



## virtual DOM, react fiber & Reconciliation :

1. createRoot feature creates an exact structure like dom 
--> then compares its dom with actual dom and make only those changes in UI which are updated
--> browser removes the whole DOM and repaints(recreates) the whole DOM structure (reloading the webpage)
--> thus, in virtual dom, trace the whole changes from a tree like structure then update only changed parts

2. react fiber : key features include the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in; the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.

3. **Reconciliation** is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "virtual DOM."

4. Although Fiber is a ground-up rewrite of the reconciler, the high-level algorithm described in the React docs will be largely the same. The key points are:
--> Different component types are assumed to generate substantially different trees. React will not attempt to diff them, but rather replace the old tree completely.
--> Diffing of lists is performed using keys. Keys should be "stable, predictable, and unique."

## Q) why should keys be used to iterate over an array in react? (if keys are not used, then also react performs the same task just with a warning)
Ans.) In React, keys are used to help identify which items in a list have changed, been added, or removed. 
--> This helps React to manage the list more efficiently and update the UI accordingly. 
--> Here are some reasons why keys are important when iterating over an array:

1. Performance Optimization:

Keys help React identify which items have changed, allowing it to re-render only those items instead of the entire list. This improves the performance of the application.

2. Stable Identity:

Keys provide a stable identity to list items. Even if the list items are rearranged, added, or removed, React can keep track of each item correctly using the keys.

3. Avoiding Unnecessary Re-Renders:

Without keys, React might re-render all the items in the list even if only one item has changed. Using keys helps React to avoid unnecessary re-renders, improving efficiency.

4. Efficient Diffing:

React uses a diffing algorithm to determine how the UI should be updated. Keys help this algorithm by giving a unique identifier to each item, making it easier to compare and update the list efficiently.

### The key points are:

1. In a UI, it's not necessary for every update to be applied immediately; in fact, doing so can be wasteful, causing frames to drop and degrading the user experience.
2. Different types of updates have different priorities â€” an animation update needs to complete more quickly than, say, an update from a data store.
3. A push-based approach requires the app (you, the programmer) to decide how to schedule work. A pull-based approach allows the framework (React) to be smart and make those decisions for you.

## What is a fiber?
We've established that a primary goal of Fiber is to enable React to take advantage of scheduling. Specifically, we need to be able to

--> pause work and come back to it later.
--> assign priority to different types of work.
--> reuse previously completed work.
--> abort work if it's no longer needed.


### useCallback
--> useCallback is a react Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.
**syntax** : const cachedFn = useCallback(fn, dependecies)
