Comprehensive List of Conditions for Choosing the Right Hook

Here's a detailed list of conditions to help you choose the right Hook for your React application:

1. State Management
- You want to store some data that persists across re-renders. → State Hooks (useState, useReducer)
- You want to manage complex state with multiple sub-states. → Reducer Hooks (useReducer)
- You want to store data that depends on other state or props. → State Hooks (useState, useReducer)

2. Side Effects
- You want to perform some side effect (e.g., API call, DOM mutation) when the component mounts or updates. → Effect Hooks (useEffect, useLayoutEffect)
- You want to handle asynchronous data or operations. → Effect Hooks (useEffect, useLayoutEffect)
- You want to clean up after a side effect (e.g., cancel API request). → Effect Hooks (useEffect, useLayoutEffect)

3. Data Sharing
- You want to share data between multiple components. → Context Hooks (useContext)
- You want to share data between a parent and child component. → Context Hooks (useContext)

4. DOM Access
- You want to access a DOM element to manipulate its styles or attributes. → Ref Hooks (useRef)
- You want to access a component's instance to call its methods. → Ref Hooks (useRef, useImperativeHandle)

5. Performance Optimization
- You want to memoize a value to prevent unnecessary re-renders. → Memo Hooks (useMemo)
- You want to memoize a function to prevent unnecessary re-renders. → Callback Hooks (useCallback)

6. Debugging
- You want to display a label for a custom Hook in React DevTools. → Debugging Hooks (useDebugValue)

7. Custom Logic
- You want to reuse logic across multiple components. → Custom Hooks
- You want to create a custom Hook to handle a specific use case. → Custom Hooks

8. Asynchronous Data
- You want to fetch data from an API or handle asynchronous operations. → Custom Hooks (e.g., useFetchData)

9. Layout Effects
- You want to handle DOM mutations (e.g., measuring the size of a DOM element). → Layout Effect Hooks (useLayoutEffect)

10. Imperative Handle
- You want to customize the instance value that's exposed to parent components when using ref. → Imperative Handle Hooks (useImperativeHandle)

11. Unique ID Generation
- You want to generate a unique ID for accessibility purposes. → ID Hooks (useId)
